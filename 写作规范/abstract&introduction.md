## abstract

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) comprise numerous sensor nodes dispersed throughout an area, tasked with monitoring and gathering data. Despite their importance in facilitating rapid access to environmental information, WSNs face challenges in energy efficiency and data security due to limitations in sensor node capabilities. As a result, protocols for WSNs must exhibit robust self-organizing abilities to ensure secure cooperation among nodes. However, the increasing prevalence of insecure information exchange among WSNs, coupled with advancements in attack platforms like drone-based assaults, poses significant security risks. Common attacks on WSNs include wormhole attacks, selective forwarding attacks, Sybil attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Wormhole attacks involve the establishment of high-speed tunnels between malicious nodes, allowing for the interception and replay of data packets. Selective forwarding attacks occur when malicious nodes selectively block or alter packets, undermining the integrity of data transmission. Sybil attacks involve nodes masquerading as multiple entities to disrupt routing mechanisms, while DoS attacks aim to overwhelm nodes with excessive traffic, leading to network disruption. Mitigating these threats requires a comprehensive understanding of WSN vulnerabilities and the implementation of tailored security measures to safeguard confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Introduction

A wireless sensor network consists of hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes distributed in an area to monitor and collect information. The primary goal of wireless sensor networks is rapid and timely access to all required information in the environment. Limitations of sensor nodes, such as battery power, transmission rates, processing hardware, and limited memory, result in lower energy efficiency and data security efficiency [1]. Protocols used in sensor networks should possess high self-organizing capabilities. Therefore, secure cooperation among sensor nodes is necessary. Currently, many sensor networks are exchanging information in extremely insecure ways. Due to their operation in environments that are often difficult to access, security issues have been historically overlooked. However, with the development of compact and energy-efficient computing systems, attackers exploit more diverse attack platforms. Traditional attacks, such as drive-by attacks (where attackers drive around attempting to discover vulnerable sensor networks), have evolved into drone attacks. These attacks exhibit the following characteristics: (1) the carried computing platform consumes significantly less energy and has greatly increased computing power compared to past platforms; (2) enhanced mobility leads to sensor networks in environments like urban areas facing the risk of access attacks; (3) serving as dedicated attack platforms lowers the cost of accessing sensor networks. Meanwhile, with the development of the Internet of Things, far more sensor networks are now deployed in environments vulnerable to attacks. Consequently, security issues in sensor networks are receiving increasing attention. Security methods applied in computer networks or routing networks can often be applied to sensor networks with certain levels of energy, computing power, and communication quality. However, for some constrained sensor networks, these methods are often not directly applicable due to the specific characteristics of such networks. Furthermore, some attack methods target the issues of energy constraints, low computing power, and poor communication quality in sensor networks, thereby compromising security attributes such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Attacks on Wireless Sensor Networks

Currently, the mainstream attack methods on wireless sensor networks include the following: wormhole attack, selective forwarding attack, Sybil attack, DoS attack and  Black Hole Attack.

#### Wormhole Attack

To initiate a Wormhole attack, attackers first establish a high-bandwidth, low-latency link (tunnel) called a wormhole link. This high-speed channel outside the network is constructed between two malicious nodes located at remote positions within the sensor network. Consequently, in a Wormhole attack, attackers form pairs of wormhole links to transmit data packets from one end to the other. Once these tunnels are created, they are presented by malicious nodes as high-quality paths to the base station of the sensor network. Thus, these malicious nodes are established as neighbors to all sensor nodes in the network. Legitimate nodes utilize these wormhole links as the shortest communication paths, enabling attackers to potentially access data. Subsequently, attackers collect packets at one end of the tunnel and replay them at the other end.

#### Selective Forwarding Attack

In multi-hop wireless sensor networks, assuming participating attacking nodes honestly receive and send messages, attackers can easily refrain from sending conceptual messages and leave them in the network. They ensure that a certain package will be received. In selective forwarding attacks, attackers prevent the transmission of packets they know are unique and have not been used. By selecting some nodes from the network, adversaries discard or alter their packets. For the sake of uncertainty, adversaries send some packets and discard others. However, such attacks can be detected and attackers can be eliminated from the routing.

#### Sybil Attack

A Sybil attack refers to a node launching an attack on a sensor network by masquerading as multiple nodes. Sybil attacks significantly impact routing mechanisms. This attack can be prevented through validation techniques. It poses some problems in resource allocation and voting. For instance, attackers can increase processing load and node memory by repeating data and parceling. As no node can simultaneously send data on more than one channel, wireless sensor nodes allocate a single channel to their neighbors and request them to send acknowledgment messages on the specified channel at a given time, then the sensor nodes randomly adjust their receivers on a channel. If no message is received from the node, it is identified as an attacking node. This routine leads to the identification of Sybil attack nodes with a high probability through continuous repetition. One of the drawbacks of this method is the increase in time synchronization and energy consumption.

#### DoS Attack

The simplest form of denial-of-service attack attempts to exhaust resources in weak nodes. Attack nodes increase traffic by excessively sending unnecessary packets, resulting in high traffic and increased energy consumption in nodes. Denial-of-service attacks not only mean attempting against some of the sensor network nodes to cause disruption, distortion, or network failure but also imply the occurrence of any event affecting memory capacity and increasing energy consumption for providing services. DoS attacks can occur at any layer of network hierarchy, making them diverse, and specialized designs are required in any network to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks.

#### Black Hole Attack

Black hole attack is a variant of wormhole attack, where after  establishing a wormhole tunnel, the attacking node discards all  information sent by other nodes, resulting in the paralysis of the  wireless sensor network. Due to its susceptibility to detection once the attack commences, it has another variant known as grey hole attack,  where attacking nodes randomly select packets to discard, significantly  reducing network performance while decreasing the probability of the  attacker being discovered. Grey hole attack can be considered as a  combination of wormhole attack and selective forwarding attack.
